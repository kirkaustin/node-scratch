# node-scratch

A streamlined web server, with REST, configuration, logging, and error handling.

Designed to be used with create-react-app to generate a client app.

Useful as a starting point for building out more fully-featured web apps with an api server.

It is expected to be wrapped with an auto-restart package such as [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).
